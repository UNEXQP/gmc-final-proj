In today's fast-paced world, efficient task management is crucial for individuals and teams to stay organized and productive. This proposal outlines the development of a Task Management App using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The application will help users to create, track, and manage their tasks effectively through a simple, intuitive interface.

2. Project Overview
The Task Management App will allow users to:

Create tasks with a title, description, and due date.
Mark tasks as complete or pending.
Edit or delete tasks as needed.
Organize tasks by categories or labels.
View tasks in different views (e.g., All Tasks, Pending, Completed).
User Authentication to ensure that users can only access their tasks.
3. Technology Stack
This app will be built using the MERN stack, which includes:

MongoDB: NoSQL database to store user data and task information.
Express.js: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
React.js: Frontend library to build the user interface.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment to run the backend server.
4. Features
User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out to securely access their tasks.
Task CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Task Filtering and Sorting: Tasks can be filtered by status (Pending/Completed) or sorted by due date.
Responsive UI: The app will be mobile-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
Data Persistence: Task data will be stored in MongoDB, ensuring data is saved between sessions.
5. System Architecture
Frontend (React): The frontend will be built with React to provide an interactive, single-page application (SPA) experience.

Components: Header, Task List, Task Item, Task Form, Authentication Forms (Login/Sign-up).
State Management: Using Reactâ€™s built-in state management for task updates.
Backend (Node.js & Express): The backend will handle API requests related to user authentication and task management.

RESTful APIs to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.
Database (MongoDB): MongoDB will store user profiles and task data in a NoSQL format.

Collections: users, tasks.
